# NAHPU API

A cross-platform Application Programming Interface (API) for the NAHPU specimen cataloging app (work in progress). It handles heavy computation for the app and provides a unified interface for the planned NAHPU suites of command line tools and Python and R libraries. The API is designed based on the SEGUL API [segul.app](https://segul.app).

## Installation
